Make a new file for this part: persistant_server.câ„¢ (copy your working basic_server.c and start with that).

    Have the server loop to accept a new clients after the first client disconnects (ctrl-c the client). That is many sequential clients, one after another.
    Close the old file descriptors before you end your loop, or you will have an ever-growing file table. (close from_client and to_client)
    You must now also add a sighandler for SIGINT. This will delete the WKP befor ending the server.
